## About Updatr.io

[Updatr.io](https://updatr.io) is a reliable update server and license manager for your premium (paid) Joomla extensions and templates, WordPress plugins and themes, or any other self-updating web-based application for which CI/CD is not possible (e.g. when your application is hosted on your customer's server, but you don't have access to the server to set up automatic deployments).
