## About UpdaterCloud

[UpdaterCloud](https://updatercloud.com) is a reliable update server and license manager for premium WordPress plugins and themes, Joomla extensions and templates, or any other web-based applications for which continuous delivery is not possible. (e.g. when your application is hosted on your customer's server and you don't have access to the server to set up automatic deployments).

**UpdaterCloud is free for all open source, non-commercial WordPress plugins and themes.**
